# Prompt two part one 
# The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor 
# safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or 
# gradually decreasing. 
# So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:
#Â - The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
# - Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
