Advent of Code Challenges in Python

Running through some of the Advent of Code challenges for each year I've missed. 
For reference: https://adventofcode.com/

I'm working through years 2022, 2023, and 2024 so far but plan to expand out as I get more time

Each of the files are python scripts, so you can run them in the usual way, but you need to 
`cd` into their directory as each has a corresponding puzzle input file

eg: for `adventofcode/2024/day_ten/hoof_it.py`
```bash
cd adventofcode/2024/day_ten/
python hoof_it.py
```
